Brandon is a fourth year math major at UC Berkeley, but is focused on statistics after being inspired by Shicheng! He loves probability, really digs distributions, and tends to spend his free time playing video games like League of Legends and Hearthstone. He is a good person because he prefers crunchy peanut butter over smooth peanut butter. As an Oakland native of Cantonese descent, he wants everyone to know that the most useful phrase in Cantonese is “Gong hei fot choi!” because it can get you money during Chinese New Year. He works as a math tutor and hopes to spread the idea that math is cool to kids. He hopes to educate others as well as himself through these blog posts!
