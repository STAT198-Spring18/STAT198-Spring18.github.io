Ishan is a junior, pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics (and a Minor in
Computer Science) at UC Berkeley. He is passionate about Theoretical Machine
Learning - specifically Representation Learning and Gradient based Algorithmic
Optimization (he will talk more about these in subsequent posts) He is currently
taking classes in Stochastic Processes, Topology, and Convex Optimization.
When he is not trying to catch up on problem sets that he has been procrastinating
on, he likes to play golf, go hiking, and eat lots of good food (mostly the last one). Ishan
also likes to take advantage of the unconventional opportunities for fun that the Bay
Area has to offer. For example, within the last month he flew an airplane and went axe
throwing.
