Sydney is a second-year student from San Diego, California studying computer science and data science at UC Berkeley. She thinks statistics is awesome because we're surrounded by it every day, whether in weather forecasts or how insurance works. In her spare time, she likes to read, listen to podcasts, and hike. Sydney's favorite book is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig.
