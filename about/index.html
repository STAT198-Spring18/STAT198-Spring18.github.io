We will set up a blog and write posts on topics related to data science. We will meet once a week for an hour. Students will be expected to write a minimum of 5 posts during the semester. The topics can be related to a course, internship, work, or of general interest to the group. All topics will be vetted by the group. Posts will be peer reviewed and instructor edited. Regular assignments will include reading and following of other statistics and data science-related blogs. The blog will use a Git-based blogging platform. No prior knowledge of Git or Markdown is necessary.   </p>
