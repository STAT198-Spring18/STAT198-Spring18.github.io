Shicheng is a fourth year statistics and applied math double major at the University of California, Berkeley. He does his best work at the Open Computing Facility, primarily focusing on meshing both data analytics and software operations and development (devops). In his spare time, he loves to read all kinds of non-fiction books, especially the ones about statistics, analytical psychology, learning theory, biographies about famous thinkers, and history.
